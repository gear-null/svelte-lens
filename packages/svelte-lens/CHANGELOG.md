# @gear-null/svelte-lens

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [#23](https://github.com/gear-null/svelte-lens/pull/23) [`1782246`](https://github.com/gear-null/svelte-lens/commit/17822463bcfe25e37283732438d63d62c91e0d3a) Thanks [@DoisKoh](https://github.com/DoisKoh)! - Security hardening release. This is the first release published from CI with an npm provenance attestation.
  - `init()` must now be called explicitly; importing the package no longer auto-initializes. Migration: `import("@gear-null/svelte-lens").then((m) => m.init())` (the CLI generates this pattern).
  - `init()` is a no-op in production builds unless `window.__SVELTE_LENS_FORCE_ENABLE__ = true` is set, preventing the inspector from shipping to end users when misconfigured.
  - `window.__SVELTE_LENS__` is locked against overwrite by third-party scripts; the `svelte-lens:init` event only fires from explicit `init()`.
  - HTML previews escape `&`, `"`, `<`, `>`; `setOptions()` filters prototype-pollution keys.
  - MCP server: loopback-only origin checks, 1 MiB body limit, session cap with leak-free lifecycle, and untrusted-content framing of page-derived context passed to agents.
  - CLI templates and detection use the scoped `@gear-null/svelte-lens` package name; custom `activationKey` option is wired through with exact modifier matching.
